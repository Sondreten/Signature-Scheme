# Signature Scheme

## Abstract
I solved this assignment by implementing the several building blocks that make up a
Signature Scheme. I chose my digital signature based on the RSA encryption, and
sha256 for my hash. I created a client-server model to exchange messages between
Alice and Bob successfully and verifying the signature.
